PURPOSE:
The Blue-Jay project is to create a recommendation engine to better predict which song a user would like to
listen to in his or her media player with minimal user input.
It will make use of more time-sensitive data than other recommendation engines typically use.
This will allow the engine to make educated guesses based on which songs go together, which mood the user may currently be in, and similar factors.

TECHNOLOGY:
We have created a plugin for the open-source media player Songbird

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
You must have the music player Songbird, which is a free and open source download available at http://getsongbird.com/
To install Blue-Jay:
1. Open Songbird.
2. Go to Tools->Addons and click "Install"
3. Navigate to the file "InstallableBlueJay.xpi" on your computer
4. When Songbird prompts you to restart Songbird, restart Songbird

USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:
1. After starting Songbird, click the pane button at the top-right corner of the screen to view the Blue-Jay user interface.
2. You may need to push Songbird's play button to start the player.
3. Now click the "One-Click Mix" button to start the engine. Click "ok" on each of the windows. Once the song changes, the engine has started successfully

To rate a song, use the bar on the right-hand side of the screen, to the right of the words "Rate Song." This gives the rating to Blue-Jay. Each rating you assign to a song has a timestamp associated with it. Just because you like a song now doesn't mean you will like it later, and vice versa.

Blue-Jay also keeps track of when you skip a song and will override the newly chosen song with a song chosen by Blue-Jay.
