PURPOSE:
The Blue-Jay project is to create a recommendation engine to better predict which song a user would like to
listen to in his or her media player with minimal user input.
It will make use of more time-sensitive data than other recommendation engines typically use.
This will allow the engine to make educated guesses based on which songs go together, which mood the user may currently be in, and similar factors.

TECHNOLOGY:
We have created a plugin for the open-source media player Songbird

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
You must have the music player Songbird, which is a free and open source download available at http://getsongbird.com/
