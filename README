PURPOSE:
The Blue-Jay project is to create a recommendation engine to better predict which song a user would like to
listen to in his or her media player with minimal user input.
It will make use of more time-sensitive data than other recommendation engines typically use.
This will allow the engine to make educated guesses based on which songs go together, which mood the user
may currently be in, what time of day it is, who else is around, and similar factors.

TECHNOLOGY:
We plan to create a plugin for the open-source media player Songbird
